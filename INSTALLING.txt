"Instructions.hs" has been provided for testing some examples,
but if you want, you can work in any hs file that imports both
Problems and Puzzle.

TO CREATE A PROBLEM: Use initProb :: [String] -> Integer -> [(String, String)]
	- [String] = a list of all items in the problem
	- Integer  = the amount of items the boat can carry at once
	- [(String, String)] = a list of item conflicts; for example,
			       [("Wolf", "Goat)] means the wolf and goat
			       may never be left alone on the same side.

TO TEST A SOLUTION: Use execProb :: Prob -> [[String]]
	- Solutions are given in the form of 2D lists, where each
	  inner list is one "step" of the problem and contains all
	  the items you wish to move on that "step."
